Computation of nodes and weights for a Gauss-Legendre quadrature formula

The  algorithm  calculates  the  nodes  and  weights of the Gauss-Legendre
quadrature formula on domain [-1, 1].

Input parameters:
    n   ï¿½   a required number of nodes.
            n>=1.

Output parameters:
    x   -   array of nodes.
            Array whose index ranges from 0 to N-1.
    w   -   array of weighting coefficients.
            Array whose index ranges from 0 to N-1.

The algorithm was designed by using information from the QUADRULE library.
